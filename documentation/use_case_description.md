# Use Case Description

## 1. Target User
The primary users of this chatbot are patients and family members in Nova Scotia who have received genetic test results indicating a rare disease—specifically Gaucher disease—and are struggling to understand the complex medical terminology. These users may not have a medical background and often feel overwhelmed, anxious, or confused by their diagnosis.

## 2. User Pain Points
- Difficulty understanding terms like "Gaucher disease," "GBA mutation," or "enzyme deficiency" in their medical reports.
- Limited access to clear, plain-language explanations of rare diseases.
- Uncertainty about where to find support groups or resources in Nova Scotia.
- Emotional distress caused by information overload and medical jargon.

## 3. Chatbot Role
The chatbot acts as a supportive, plain-language medical terminology guide. It helps users:
- Understand Gaucher disease and related terms in simple language.
- Learn where to find peer support, clinical services, and advocacy organizations in Nova Scotia.
- Get reliable, structured information without replacing professional medical guidance.

The chatbot is friendly, calm, and non-alarming in tone. It explains terms, summarizes resources, and emphasizes that all medical decisions should be made with a qualified healthcare provider.

## 4. Success Criteria
- Users receive a clear, easy-to-understand explanation of “Gaucher disease.”
- Users discover legitimate support resources in Nova Scotia (e.g., IWK, CORD, NGF).
- Users feel less anxious and more informed about their condition.
- The chatbot stays within scope: it never provides a diagnosis or treatment plan.

## 5. Ethical Boundaries
- The chatbot clearly states: **“This tool does not provide medical diagnoses.”**
- In cases of crisis or self-harm risk, it advises users to call 911 or visit an emergency room.
- The chatbot does not collect personal data or store user queries.
